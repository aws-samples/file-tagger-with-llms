    "# Build a content-based file tagging system with LLMs on Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) is a popular object storage service on AWS. You can store any type of file as an object in a S3 bucket. Although you can write files of a specific type or context within a specific directory structure (path) in S3, it will be useful to add metadata to the files like it's content description, owner, context etc. so you can easily retrieve the file that you are looking for. There are two ways to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1: Use the user-defined metadata feature in S3**\n",
    "\n",
    "While uploading an object to a S3 bucket, you can optionally assign user-defined metadata as key-values pairs to the object. This will be stored along with the object. This cannot be added later on to an existing object. The only way to modify object metadata is to make a copy of the object and set the metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: Store the metadata in an external system with a reference to the object in S3**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to set metadata to an existing object in S3 without copying that object or if you want to add to an existing metadata system that already exist, then it will make sense to store the metadata in an external system, like an Amazon DynamoDB table for example. This option is also applicable if the data is stored outside S3 and needs to be tagged with metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both of these options, if you do not know the metadata that describes the data stored in the object, then, you have to read the object, analyze it's content and generate the appropriate metadata. This is where AI can help.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing Foundation Models (FMs) from leading AI companies accessible through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications, simplifying development while maintaining privacy and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) are a type of Foundation Model that can take natural langauge as input, with the ability to process and understand it, and produce natural language as the output. LLMs can also can perform tasks like classification, summarization, simplification, entity recognition, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk you through the process of analyzing text-content or image-content in files stored in S3 using a Large Language Model (LLM) hosted on [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), generating metadata based on the content of the files and storing them as key-value pairs (tags) in an [Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html) table with a reference to the files in S3. In the process, you will learn how to setup the Amazon Bedrock client environment, configure security permissions and use prompt templates. You will also learn how to use Amazon Bedrock's [Converse API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.html) to consistently interact with multiple supported LLMs and easily send documents of various types into the prompts of those LLMs. Finally, you will learn some techniques for analyzing files with mixed content (text and images)."

    "\n",
    "**Technique 1**: Prior to invoking the LLM using the Amazon Bedrock Converse API, convert every page in the document to an image. This will be like taking a screenshot of every page in the document. When you do this, you will be dealing with only images and no text at all. Now, you can invoke the LLM using the Converse API by specifying the content type as 'image' and pass in the image bytes. Make sure you pick a LLM that supports [Vision with Converse API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference-supported-models-features.html). You can refer to the code sample [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference-examples.html). At the time of writing this notebook, Converse API supported up to 20 images in one API call. Each imageâ€™s size, height, and width must be no more than 3.75 MB, 8000 px, and 8000 px, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technique 2**: From each page in a document, read the image content separately as bytes. Then, read the text content (if any) separately. Now, create a list of messages with these info and send them to the LLM in the prompt. For example, if you are using Anthropic Claude 3.x models on Amazon Bedrock that support image (vision) and text in the input, then, you can use the [Messages API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-anthropic-claude-messages.html#model-parameters-anthropic-claude-messages-request-response) for this. Note that, depending on the LLM-specific API, you may have to encode the bytes as Base64 and also specify the image type."
